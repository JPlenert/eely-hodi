HoDi is a 64x32 matrix LED display driven by a ESP32 that shows:

* the current time
* energy consumptions (with shelly sensors)
* energy productions (with shelly sensors)
* temperatures (with shelly sensors)
* energy prices (with tibber)

## How to build

Use the following directory structure and repositories:

````
eely/
├─ eely-base-web (https://github.com/JPlenert/eely-base-web)
├─ eely-esp-components
│  ├─ components
│     ├─ eely-base-esp (https://github.com/JPlenert/eely-base-esp)
│     ├─ eely-smart-matrix (https://github.com/JPlenert/eely-smart-matrix)
├─ eely-hodi (this repository)
````

Build order:

* Build eely-hodi-web
* Minimize index.html (.\buildSingle.ps1)
* Build eely-hodi-esp

Uses ESP-IDF V5.3 for espressif ESP32.

## Remark

This a private hobbyist (aka maker) project that helps me to ['sharpen the saw'](https://blog.codinghorror.com/sharpening-the-saw/) as a Director of a Software innovation unit.
Since I'm more a "backend guy" (white characters on black screen), the frontend is a really "quick and DIRTY" implementation!
